  description: '"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
    pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of
    the system and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth
    the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects dislikes or avoids pleasure
    itself because it is pleasure but because those who do not know how to pursue
    pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again
    is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself because
    it is pain but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain
    can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example which of us ever
    undertakes laborious physical exercise except to obtain some advantage from it?
    But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure
    that has no annoying consequences or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant
    pleasure?"'
